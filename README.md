# Shapefile example

This is a simple JS application built on top of webpack to show what can be done with shapefiles. It uses shapefiles 
from opendata.swiss and leaflet.js and CartoDB for displaying them. For a full introduction, see the blog post on liip.ch.

## Local setup

Clone this repository and execute the following commands:

```
    npm install
    webpack-dev-server
```

The app is now available on localhost:8080
